# EHR Map

This is an attempt to visualize data published by the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) on [healthdata.gov](http://www.healthdata.gov/data/dataset/cms-medicare-and-medicaid-ehr-incentive-program-electronic-health-record-products-used). It provides information about where and when providers attested for meaningful use EHR incentives, what EHR vendor they used for attestation etc...

Map and charts are interactive, so slice the data and see what happens.
The page relies on the super awesome Dimensional Charting Javascript Library [dc.js](http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js)
